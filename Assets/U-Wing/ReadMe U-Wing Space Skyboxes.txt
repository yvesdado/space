U-Wing:  Space Skyboxes

Travel the universe with Space Skyboxes from Ultra Real.  

Over 20 beautiful space Skyboxes.

Usage:

1.  Create a camera, or GameObject with a camera component attached to it.
2.  On that camera, add the SkyBox component.
3.  In the Skybox Component, set the “Custom Skybox” material to any of the materials located in the “U-Wing/Materials/Skyboxes/SpaceSkyboxes” directory.  You’ll have your choice of two scales for your skybox: 1024 and 2048.  1024 is suitable for mobile, while 2048 is more likely suitable for standalone.
